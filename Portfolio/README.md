# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a  portfolio website developed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The website was made by me for Frontend practice in my initial phase with the help of tutorials.

It contains all the sections which should be present in a portfolio website.
however it is just a landing page and users can add their projects, social accounts themselves.
