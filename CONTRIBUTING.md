# Contributing guidelines

## Before contributing

Welcome to [WebArena](https://github.com/anadee11/WebArena). Before sending your pull requests, make sure that you **read the whole guidelines**. If you have any doubt on the contributing guide, please feel free to email me on work.anadee@gmail.com .

### Contribution

We appreciate any contribution, from from a very basic project to some cool projects. Please read this section if you are contributing your work.

#### Folder Structure

We want your work to be readable by others; therefore, we encourage you to note the following:

- Make a new folder with name of the project you are contributing.
- In this folder, put the files and a readme.md file.
- The readme.md file should describe the project.


#### Other points to remember while submitting your work:
- Won't be accepting PR's without issues being raised and assigned.
- Avoid infringement with the code of other projects, do not make your folder inside the other project .
- Do not update the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.
Happy Coding :)
