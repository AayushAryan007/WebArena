# React Food Ordering Website
This is a food ordering website built with React and context API. It has a menu of dishes to order items that get added to user's cart. The cart is fully functional with options of incrementing/ decrementing individual items and also removing them.
On confirming, the user is shown a form to enter their details and place their order. Successful order submission is shown by a confirmation Modal.
It uses Firebase to store order and user details.
